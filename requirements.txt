# Note: Removed heavy dependencies to fit Vercel's 250MB limit:
# - pandas: Not used in main application (only in compute_recall.py which is excluded)
# - scikit-learn: Replaced with manual cosine similarity calculation
# - cython: Not needed for runtime
# - sentence-transformers: Removed (~2GB+ savings)
# The code will use OpenAI API (if OPENAI_API_KEY is set) or fallback to random embeddings
